## üöÄ Deploying the Node.js App in Production (Linux + PM2)

This guide explains how to deploy and keep your Node.js app running permanently in the background using **PM2**, with automatic restarts on crashes and reboots.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

* **Node.js** and **npm** installed
* **PM2** installed globally
* Access to a Linux server (with `sudo` privileges)
* Your app‚Äôs code deployed on the server

Install PM2 globally:

```bash
npm install -g pm2
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

Navigate to your app‚Äôs root directory and install all dependencies:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/app
npm install
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Initial Database Setup (Run Once)

**Step 1:** Create the database schema:

```bash
node config/schema-runner.js
```

**Step 2:** Populate the database with initial data:

```bash
node config/seed.js
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è These steps are only needed **once** during the initial setup.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Start the App with PM2

Start your app with PM2:

```bash
pm2 start server.js --name "my-node-app"
```

Replace `server.js` with the entry point of your app if different.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Enable Automatic Restart on Reboot

To make PM2 restart your app automatically after a system reboot:

```bash
pm2 startup
```

This will print a command‚Äîcopy and run it (usually something like `sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin pm2 startup systemd -u username --hp /home/username`).

Save the PM2 process list:

```bash
pm2 save
```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Useful PM2 Commands

| Command                                    | Description             |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `pm2 start server.js --name "my-node-app"` | Start the app           |
| `pm2 stop my-node-app`                     | Stop the app            |
| `pm2 restart my-node-app`                  | Restart the app         |
| `pm2 delete my-node-app`                   | Remove the app from PM2 |
| `pm2 logs my-node-app`                     | View logs               |
| `pm2 list`                                 | List all running apps   |

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Crash Recovery

PM2 automatically restarts the app if it crashes.
You don‚Äôt need to run any special command for this‚Äîonce your app is started and saved in PM2, it will keep running.
